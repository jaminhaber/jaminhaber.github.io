          Brex is a constant source of challenges and opportunity. During my
          time I have worked on two teams:
        </p>
        <h2 id="budgets">Budgets</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I joined the budgets team to help launch the Empower spend
          management product. During that time I implemented many core features
          under the mentorship of the senior engineers on the team. Some of
          these features included: notifications, internal tooling, feature
          toggles, performance improvements and more. I also helped to onboard
          new engineers and define team process, which opened the door for me to
          get promoted to senior engineer and join the travel team.
        </p>
        <h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
        <p>

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          On the Travel team I have been driving many key features of the Brex
          Travel experience. As one can imagine, travel is an extremely deep
          product with so many moving parts that must work together to create a
          great experience for the customer. As a senior engineer on the travel
          team, I define implementation for much larger features and take
          success into my own hands on behalf of the team. I get to define
          product requirements and lead implementation of multiple projects at
          once by breaking down projects into smaller deliverables and
          paralleling work amongst myself and my peers. Although the saga is
          just beginning, I am looking forward to the opportunities that lie
          ahead
