        <p>
          It's no secret that video games are fun, that's why people play them!
          A lot of meticulous work goes into making them like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making games is nothing like playing them. Games typically reward the
          player instantly for doing what they are supposed to, while game
          development is a labor of love. The time between action and reward is
          much longer, but the magnitude of reward is far greater than what can
          be granted within a game.

          Most people immediately get excited about developing a multiplayer
          game like Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch, Rainbow 6, Valorant,
          Roblox etc. While this is a good goal, these games take an immense
          amount of work to build and sustain. They are usually maintained by
          large companies staffed with teams of experts.

          I've only ever made 2D games and I'm writing about making games which
          puts me somewhere right after "knows nothing".
        </p>
        <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
        <h4 id="computeroptional">Computer (optional)</h4>
        <p>
          Most people think of games as the computer / console variety. However,
          the vast majority of games don't even use computers: Sports, board
          games, card games, and word games are all examples of this. If you
          want to develop video games, learning from these other games will
          unlock your full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article will focus on computer games, so its recommended to use a
          computer.
        </p>
        <h4 id="basicmath">Basic Math</h4>
        <p>
          Most games use math behind the scenes to make things work. The math
          gets much more complicated for 3D games, so if you want to keep the
          math part simple, start with a 2D game.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience, making games actually helps solidify concepts in
          math and leads to a deeper understanding how math applies to daily
          life.
        </p>
        <h4 id="time">Time</h4>
        <p>
          Making games takes a long time. You will have to commit to it if you
          want to make a game worth playing. If you play a lot of games, that
          might be a good place to cut time from your schedule to make them.
        </p>
        <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
        <p>
          Designing the game you want to make is the most important step. This
          should probably take place on a piece of paper or drawing software
          where you can let ideas flow freely.
        </p>
        <p>In this phase you should think of your game abstractly:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>what is the goal?</li>
          <li>what is the reward?</li>
          <li>what is the obstacle?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These are some examples of games I have made as abstract concepts:
        </p>
        <h4 id="arcade">Arcade</h4>
        <p>
          Two players (or a player and an AI) compete against each other for a
          common goal. This can be draining their health, getting a ball into a
          goal, beating their score or anything else you can come up with.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>goal: score points</li>
          <li>reward: beating an opponent</li>
          <li>obstacle: another person</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <p>
          Roguelike commonly refers to games with progression, perma-death, and
          randomly generated levels. In a simple example, the player moves
          around and picks up randomly spawning weapons / powerups while
          fighting an ever-increasing onslaught of enemies. When the player
          dies, they must restart the game.

          <li>goal: survice</li>
          <li>reward: better weapons</li>
          <li>obstacle: enemies who get stronger / more numerous over time.</li>

          This list is not exhaustive or correct, but should provide a starting
          point to try and imagine what can be done.

        <ol>
          <li>Platformer</li>
          <li>Story game</li>
          <li>Shooter</li>
          <li>RPG</li>
        </ol>
        <p>â€¦ Or any mix of the genres!</p>
        <h2 id="theming">Theming</h2>
        <p>
          The world that your game will take place in is almost as important as
          the game itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does your game take place in a fantasy world? In the future? On a
          yacht off the coast of Italy? Inside the human body? In space? There
          are really no rules to this.
        </p>

        <h2 id="pickingagameengine">Picking a game engine</h2>
        <p>
          You should pick a game engine and learn how to use it. This is the
          primary goal of building your first game. Even if the game sucks, you
          should have ideas of how you could make it better if you were to start
          again.

          I recommend <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> because its

        <h2 id="buildingyourgame">Building your game</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have chosen a game engine, you will have to find a way to
          model your game in a way that works with the engine. Below are some
          common concepts between game engines:
        </p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            Entity - an object that exists within the game (player, enemy,
            bullet, spell, coin)
          </li>
          <li>Transform - the position of an entity in the world</li>
          <li>State - data (score, health, mana)</li>
          <li>Sprite - an image that exists within a game</li>
          <li>
            Collisions - detect when two entities overlap and execute some logic
          </li>
          <li>Keyboard input - do something when a key is pushed</li>
          <li>
            Mouse input - responding to the position of the cursor as well as
            mouse clicks
          </li>
          <li>Event loop - a fixed set of commands that run in a loop</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="headballexample">Head-ball example</h4>
        <p>
          Lets say there is a game where the player must keep a ball from
          touching the floor by moving left and right. When they hit the ball,
          it bounces up, but comes back down due to gravity.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Entities</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ball</li>
          <li>Player</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ball / Player collision -&gt; bounce ball up</li>
          <li>Ball / floor collision -&gt; End game</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Keyboard input</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>move player left / right</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Event Loop</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Move ball based on velocity</li>
          <li>Apply gravity to ball (accelerate down)</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2 id="themaths">The maths</h2>
        <h4 id="geometry">Geometry</h4>
        <p>
          Geometry is useful in collision detection. Most objects in games are
          represented as either rectangles or circles, which makes it easy to
          compute how far they are from each other.
        </p>
        <h4 id="algebra">Algebra</h4>
        <p>
          A 2D game will always take place on a grid. The position (transform)
          of an entity can be understood as a distance from the origin of the
          grid. You will need to move things around the grid as well as use some
          basic math to determine the distance between things on the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vibecheck.imgix.net/portfolio/blog/game_math_axes.png?s=d8137ebbc16af40e1999c21eff486b76"
            alt="Algebra"
          />
        </p>
        <h4 id="physicscalculus">Physics / Calculus</h4>
        <p>
          The word calculus is scary but is actually somewhat mundane and
          universally understood. The key concept for application to game design
          is the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine a car that moves along a line.</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vibecheck.imgix.net/portfolio/blog/game_math_calc.png?s=5da3c236db1c25bdd5c1092ef7a5d34b"
            alt="Game Calculus"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          In your game you can move things either by position, velocity, or
          acceleration.
        </p>
        <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have the game working, you should play it over and over
          again. This will help you discover issues as well as opportunities you
          may not have noticed when you were initially designing your game.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are satisfied, its time to collect feedback from others. Good
          feedback is extremely valuable and hard to find, so its important to
          follow these rules:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fresh eyes are like gold - people only get to play your game for the
            first time once, so pay extra close attention to what they do, what
            they like, and where they get stuck.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't explain too much - if you preface the game, you will influence
            how the tester sees the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask for the feedback you want - if you just want approval and
            encouragement, say that. If you want structured feedback, or ideas
            for improvement, say that. This will prevent feelings from getting
            hurt!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="thatsit">Thats it!</h2>
        <p>
          Once you are happy with your game, you should find a way to export it
          and store it somewhere so you can come back to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are proud of it, you can try to put it online. Many people post
          games to places like <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a>. If you
          are not proud of it, keep it somewhere so you can see how much you
          improved after your next game.
