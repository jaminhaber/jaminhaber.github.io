          [2023] Thoughts on being a Software Engineer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being a software engineer is interesting because you begin to
          understand how businesses really operate. The entire world runs on
          code, and itâ€™s not as stable or permanent as everyone takes it to be.
          More to come later on.

          [2018] Thoughts on working in Film
        </h2>
        <p>It would be untruthful to call myself a filmmaker at this point.</p>
        <p>
          In 2018 I made a career pivot. At the time, I was working as a local
          52 union film electric contractor in New York City. I was not
          officially in the union, but I was regularly contracted to work on
          shows when someone dropped out (a surprisingly frequent occurrence).
        </p>
        <p>
          The work was hard but rewarding. I would frequently work 12+ hour
          days, which added up when being paid hourly. I was mostly tasked with
          gathering equipment from the truck into a cart and wheeling it a few
          blocks away to where the shoot was taking place.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt silly doing this after having paid 4 years of tuition at NYU.
        </p>

          [2016] Thoughts on being a Filmmaker
        </h2>
        <p>
          Studying film at NYU was an opportunity to be surrounded by some of
          the most passionate people I have met on my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent almost every weekend working on a film set in addition to my
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>I made a few films of my own, which I am mostly proud of.</p>
        <p>
          Being a filmmaker was by far the hardest thing I have ever done, and
          rarely rewarding. In order to succeed in this field, you have to
          really love it.

          Working at an amusement part sounds like a good idea until you realize
          the biggest perk is being allowed to come say hi to your coworkers on
          your day off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also at the park I worked at, there was a hierarchy of the jobs.
          Ranked from coolest to least cool, it went: Rides, Food, Shops. I
          worked in the shops.

          [2013] Thoughts on being a Zamboni driver
        </h2>
        <p>
          This was by far my favorite job, unfortunately it did not pay very
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was super intimidating at first but was easy to pick up. There was
          an optimal path to follow, and hitting the walls a little bit was not
          the end of the world. That being said, if I were to stop at any point
          while out on the ice, or hit the wall too hard - they would have to
          melt the ice around the blade to get the Zamboni unstuck, so I made
          sure never to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot of precision in driving close enough to the edge to get
          the ice, which I feel like helped me be a better driver in general.
        </p>
        <p>We also melted and re-iced the place once, which took days.</p>

          [2012] Thoughts on being a Library Assistant
        </h2>
        <p>
          I forgot her name, but the librarian (god rest her soul) was a woman
          who had completely dedicated her life to the joy and enrichment of the
          children who came to the library. If angels walked amongst us, they
          would treat her soul as equal.
        </p>
        <p>My task was to sort books after people picked them off the shelf.</p>
        <p>
          My most valuable lesson was how to sort things from A-Z relatively
          quickly and with minimal effort (binary search).

        <p>
          Being a kid is fun because you can do whatever you want. Only catch is
          that everyone tells you what to do.
